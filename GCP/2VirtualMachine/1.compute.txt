################################Google Cloud Compute Engine/ Virtual Machine ######################### 

in compute many services
Compute Engine
(i) Server Based service
1)Vmware Engine
2)K8s Engine
3)computeEngine

(ii) without server based(serverless)
1)AppEngine
2)CloudRun
3)CloudFunction

Compute Engine:- It is a customizable compute service that lets you create and run Virtual machine on Google
infrastructure

There are two type of machine in gcp:-
1)Custom Machine:-
You can take vcpu and memory as you need and create your own custom machine

2)Predefined machine:-
Predefined machine type are prebuilt and ready to go configuration of vm with specific amount  of vcpu and memory to start running app quickly

=>Google computeEngine comes under Iaas:-
=>Virtual Machine is like physical hardware server but running  in the cloud
=>Gcp isolate resource and settle them on a per server basis with different combination
=>Google provide vm of all sizes=> micro to 160 vcpu and 3.75 tb memory
=>you can attach local ssd up to 3 tb and persistent disk up to 64tb that to encrypted as well
=>Google cloud use open source kvm hypervisor at backend
=>Fast booting time among all cloud provider
=>all vcpu,gcp and GB of memory are charged minimum of 1 minute after 1 min instance are changed in 1 sec  of increment


####################### Types of Predefined VM #############################

1)General Purpose
2)compute optimised
3)memory optimised
4)Accelarated optimised
5)shared core

=>MAchine type is a set of Virtualised hardware resource availble to a Virtual machine including the system memory vcpu and persistent disk limit
=>In compute engine machine type are grouped and put inside families on their behaivour and workload

##############################Compute Engine has 3 terms##############################

machine family:- Set of processors and hardware configuration


services:-MAchine families are further classified by series and General


MAchine type: Every machine series are Predefined machine type that provide a  set of resources

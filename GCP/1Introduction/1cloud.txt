################################## cloud computing:- ######################################
it isa delivery of computing services like  server,storage,database,networking tools and software over the internet

characteristic of cloud computing:-
1)on demand service:
2)broad network access:-any hardware, or any network to use for access   
3)Resource pooling:-sharing of resources 
4)Rapid elasticity:-easily upgrade and decrease
5)measured services:- everything is measure
6)pay as you go:-like electricity bill



############################# cloud provide 3 type of services:- ##################################
1)IAAS->
-------------
-------------
-------------
-------------
virtualization
server
storage
networking

ex:-ec2,vm,compute engine, cloud storage


2)PAAS:-
--------
Runtime
Middleware
OS
virtualization
server
storage
networking

ex:- GKE, cloud Function, cloud run, cloud app engine

3)SAAS:-
Application
Runtime
Middleware
OS
virtualization
server
storage
networking

ex:google drive,google workspace,gmail

########################### Types of cloud  ############################

1)Public cloud:- Anyone can access this cloud via internet across this globe
it is secure
ex:- azure, aws, gcp

2)private cloud:- 
it is highly secure

3)Hybrid cloud:- public + private cloud

################################### Concept of Zone , Region , Multi Region ################################
1)Multi Region:-2
Multi Region is designed to Function  the loss of single region
some service for gcp support for multi region are like bigQuery, bigTable, cloudStorage,firestore,
spanner, Datastore, artifactRegistry


2)Region:-36
Independent geographical areas that consist of zones. this effect on pricing,reliability, networking or performance
ex-appEngine


3)Zone/Data center:109
It is deployment area for google cloud resources with in a region zone should be considered a single failure domain with in a region.To deploy the fault tolerant application with high availibility and protect against unexpected failure deploy your application across Multiple zone in a region
ex-virtual machine 



Network edge Location:176
more than 200+countries

Note: Each region has 3 zone except iowa region has 4 zone 
India has two region :Delhi, Mumbai
Two Zone has far 100 miles or far 

Note:- If a single region fail only customer in that region are impacted customer who has multi-region products are not impacted

Note:- region always end with number
zone always end with alphabet
ex:- us-central1-a

############################### Live Migration:- ####################################
if one zone is working it is automatically Migrate

fault tolerance:-
High availability:-
Latency:-
Redundancy:-

=>If your existing machine is not fit for the existing workloads you run n your vm change the machine type of that vm (Vertical Scaling)
=>IF your vm does not have a local ssd and it is not part of managed instance group(MIG).
you can change the machine type of your vm after stopping it
=>if your vm has local ssd you can stop the vm to change its machine type unless you force it stop,which cause you lose all the data on the local ssd
=>changing a machine type might also affect the sustained use discount for that vm
=>you can only change the machine type of a stopped VM. you can not change the machine type of a running vm
=>Take snapshot before updating  size
=> For vm don not have a local ssd and are not part of MIG, you can change the machine type without affecting the following resource:-
a)the VM SSH key
b)The VM configuration such as meta data
c)Persistent disk data installed application and app data


################################## Lab in gui:- #########################################################

1)First stop the maching
2)change the machine type 


################################### Lab in cloud shell ######################################

1)stop the machine
gcloud compute instances stop old-vm

2)change the machine type
gcloud compute instances set-machine-type old-vm --machine-type e2-micro

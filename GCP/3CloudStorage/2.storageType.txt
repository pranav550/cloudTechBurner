########################## All storage class provide the following:- ###########################
=>unlimited storage with no minimum object size
=>worldwide and world wide storage locations
=>low latency
=>High Durability (99.999999999)
=>Geo redundancy, if data is stored in Multi-region or dual-region
=>A uniform experience with cloud storage feature,security tools and api
=>Object written to cloud storage must be redundantly stored in at least 2 availability zone before the write is acknowledge and successful 
=>Max size of an object stored in cloud bucket is 5tb 
=>there is 100 acl limit per object
=>A multiple upload can have up to 10,000 parts An individual part is max size limit of 5tb size limit

############################# standard Storage ################################

=>standard storage is best for data that is frequently accessed(Hot data) or stored for only brief periods of time
=>when used in a region,standard storage is appropriate for string data in the same location as GKE cluster or compute engine instance that use the data
=>Regional storage is redundant written a region
=>when used in dual region improved availability
=>when used in multi region ideal for string data that is accessed around the world such as serving website content, streaming video,executing interactive workloads or serving gaming data or apps
=>multi Regional is a geo redundant stored across 2 or more region which are 500 miles apart


Availability of standard storage data is :-
Location Type              Availability SLA
Multi Region                    99.95%   
Dual Region                     99.95%
Regional                        99.90%

########################## NearLine Storage ###############################

NearLine Storage is a low cost highly durable storage service for string infrequently accessed data

=>NearLine Storage is a better choice than standard storage in sceanarios where slightly lower availability , a 30 day minimum storage duration and cost for data access are acceptable  trade off for lowered at rest storage cost
=>NewLine Storage is ideal for data you plan to read or modify on average once per month


###################Availability of nearLine storage of  data is ###########################

Location Type              Availability SLA
Multi Region                    99.9%   
Dual Region                     99.9%
Regional                        99.0%


###################################### Code Line Storage ########################################
=>coldLine storage provide very low cost highly durable storage service for storing infrequently accessed data(cold data)
=>ColdLine Storage is ideal for data you plan to read or modify at most once in quarter 


=>######################## Availability is same is nearLine #############################


############################ Archive Storage ####################################

=>Archive Storage is the cheapest and highly durable storage service for data archiving online backup and disaster recovery

=>unlike the coldest storage service offered by other cloud provide your data is available with in millisecond not hour or days

=>Archive storage for higher cost for data access, as well  as 365 days minimum storage duration

=>Archive storage is the best choice for data that u plan to access less than once a year

=>Availability is same as NewLine and coldLine

=>Consider storing your data in multi region or dual region bucket location if high availability is the top requirement

=>All data is stored in geo redundantly  in these location which means your data is stored in at least two geographical separated region. In the unliked event like region wide outage bucket in geo redundant location remain available with no need to change the storage path

=> you can change the bucket location or project after creation

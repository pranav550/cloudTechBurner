Cloud Storage pricing based on following components:-
1)Data Storage
2)Data Processing
3)Network Usage

Data Storage:- the amount of data stored in your bucket storage rates vary depending on the storage class of your data and location of your bucket

Data Processing:- the processing done by cloud storage which includes operation changes any applicable retrieval fees and inter-region replication

Network Usage:- the amount of data read from or moved b/w your bucket

for eg:- Data storage cost in IOWA

                 Standard    NearLine    ColdLine    Archive
Regional          $0.020      $0.010       $0.004     $0.002
